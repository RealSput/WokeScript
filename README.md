# WokeScript
The most woke JavaScript superset ever

# Usage
WokeScript is nearly the same as JavaScript, except variables have to be gendered, for example:
```
let v(he/him) = 5;
console.log(he(v)); // you can also use `him(v)`;
```
Misgendering your variables will result in an error.

# Installation
You can install WokeScript through NPM:
```
npm i -g wokescript
```

# CLI Usage
```
WokeScript (version 1.0) 
The most woke JavaScript superset ever 

Usage: wokescript [options]
Options:
--transpile (short: -t): Transpiles code

# Pronouns
There are currently three possible pronouns:
- he/him
- she/her
- they/them

The amount of possible pronouns will expand in future updates.

# Functions
There are a couple of functions in WokeScript, and all of the functions listed are for gendering variables:
- he
- him
- she
- her
- they
- them
There is also a `pronouns` function, which returns the pronouns of a variable when they are unknown.

# Note
This is very broken currently and will probably error. Report issues at https://github.com/RealSput/wokescript/issues
